# Stock Prediction
S&P 500 is the stock market index that measures the stock performance of 500 large companies in the US.
In this project, I built models to predict the stock prices for it based on the available variables and historical data.
I used machine learning algorithms like Random forests, nearest neighbor (KNN), Neural networks, Ensemble, and LSTM models in this project
